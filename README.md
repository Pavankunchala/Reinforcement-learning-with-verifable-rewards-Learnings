# Reinforcement Learning Learnings

This repository is a collection of my personal projects and experiments in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly focusing on techniques involving language models.

## Projects

The projects are organized into subdirectories within the `projects/` folder. Each project is self-contained with its own README and dependency list.

-   **[TRL PPO Fine-Tuning](./projects/trl-ppo-fine-tuning/)**: An example of fine-tuning a language model using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the `trl` library.
